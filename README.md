A friend-finder app designed with you in mind!

## DESCRIPTION
Minglewith is a social application that utilizes a friend-matching alogrithm to pair users with others based on responses to a personality survey. Once the user submits their response, the application will grab the values from the answers and pair them with the results of another user who scored the closest. At this point, the user will be able to see who their best friend match is.
